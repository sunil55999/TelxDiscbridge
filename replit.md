# Telegram → Discord → Telegram Forwarding Bot

## Overview

This is a complete Python-based message forwarding bot that creates a bridge between Telegram and Discord platforms. The system receives messages from Telegram source chats (via user sessions), relays them through Discord channels, and then forwards them to Telegram destination chats. The bot operates on a pair-based routing system where each forwarding pair defines a unique connection between a Telegram source, Discord channel, and Telegram destination.

**Current Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE FUNCTIONAL IMPLEMENTATION** - All requirements from functional checklist fully implemented and verified. Comprehensive per-pair bot token architecture, advanced filtering system, alert monitoring, enhanced admin interface, and complete security implementation. Ready for API credential configuration and production deployment.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modular, asynchronous architecture built around Python's asyncio framework. The system is designed to handle multiple forwarding pairs efficiently using worker processes and provides administrative control through Telegram bot commands.

### Configuration Management
The project uses a flexible configuration system that supports both local development and production deployments:
- **.env files** for local development with sensitive credentials
- **System environment variables** for production deployments (Replit, Heroku, Docker)
- **YAML configuration** for non-sensitive defaults and backward compatibility
- **EnvLoader utility** for type-safe environment variable parsing with intelligent fallbacks

### Core Architecture Components

1. **Message Orchestrator**: Central coordinator that manages the flow between all platform handlers
2. **Platform Handlers**: Separate modules for Telegram source (Telethon), Discord relay (discord.py), and Telegram destination (python-telegram-bot)
3. **Session Management**: Secure handling of Telegram user sessions with encryption
4. **Database Layer**: SQLAlchemy-based data persistence for forwarding pairs and message mappings
5. **Admin Interface**: Telegram bot for configuration and monitoring
