Recommendations for Improving the Telegram ↔ Discord ↔ Telegram Forwarding Bot Architecture
1. Error Handling & Observability
Unified Error Middleware: Ensure all handlers use centralized error capture, with automatic error reporting to an admin channel and detailed tracebacks for faster troubleshooting.

Structured Logging: Enhance log granularity with per-process, per-pair, and per-session tags to aid correlation during incident analysis.

Prometheus/Grafana Metrics: Expose detailed health endpoints for resource tracking (message latency, API error rates, delivery failures) to enable proactive monitoring.


2. Robust Session & Token Lifecycle
Proactive Session Health Monitoring: Automatically probe session/bot token health at short intervals and before each posting operation, with instant failover when issues are detected.

Automated Session Cleanup: Schedule regular sweeps to remove orphaned sessions, unused tokens, or stuck worker processes, freeing up resources.

Graceful Session and Token Rotation: Enable in-bot rotation commands that allow seamless switchover of sessions/tokens for security or operational reasons, with worker handover and downtime minimization.

2. UX and Admin Experience
Pair Creation Wizard Enhancements: Implement multi-step, interactive commands (e.g., inline keyboards, confirmations, validation steps) to reduce setup errors and boost clarity.

Rich Feedback and Inline Guidance: Provide contextual help and validation errors inline during complex multi-part commands such as /addpair.

Command Autocomplete & Suggestions: Offer admin users command suggestions or autocompletion (if supported by the Telegram UI) to reduce friction.

3. Message Handling Improvements
Advanced Format Detection & Fallback: Build layered fallbacks for unsupported message types—attempt richest mapping first, then gracefully degrade (e.g., send caption with a “content not supported” label).

Enhanced Poll and Media Handling: For complex media (albums, multi-poll questions), support batching and chunked forwarding to replicate the source experience as closely as possible.

Adaptive Rate Limiting: Dynamically modulate API call rates by observing failures/successes, avoiding bans or mutes during high-volume operation.

4. Advanced Filtering & Moderation
Regex-Based Filtering: Allow advanced per-pair or global regex for highly flexible and powerful keyword filtering.
