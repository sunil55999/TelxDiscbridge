‚úÖ Comprehensive Verification Checklist: Telegram‚ÜíDiscord‚ÜíTelegram Forwarding Bot
1. Multi-Session Handling
 System supports multiple Telegram user sessions.

 Every forwarding pair has an explicitly defined source Telegram session.

 Changing session for one, many, or all selected pairs is possible via admin command or config.

 Authentication and removal of sessions work as intended.

 Sessions are securely stored and periodically validated for health and access rights.

2. Admin Bot and Pair Management
 All setup, configuration, and management operations are available via Telegram Bot commands with no external UI.

 Only authorized admin Telegram user IDs can execute privileged commands.

 No bot tokens or sensitive data are ever exposed in logs or admin messages.

 Admin can add, edit, remove, and list pairs (with unique names/IDs per pair).

 /addpair and /editpair commands require:

Telegram source session

Discord webhook URL

Telegram destination channel ID

Telegram bot token (per pair), stored securely

Optional config (image block, keyword block, format controls, etc.)

3. Bot Tokens and Destination Posting
 On pair creation/edit:

Telegram bot token validity is checked with Bot API (getMe).

Bot‚Äôs ability to post in the target channel/group is verified.

Token is required, stored encrypted, and never displayed in responses.

 Each pair uses its assigned bot token for posting at the destination.

 Removal of a pair securely wipes the associated bot token.

4. Message Forwarding Flow (TG ‚Üí Discord ‚Üí TG)
 Telegram source messages are reliably relayed to Discord via the correct webhook for each pair.

 Discord ‚Üí Telegram message flow uses the correct destination bot token for the Telegram posting chat.

 All supported message types (see Section 8) are handled and filtered correctly.

 Pair-level and global settings control image/media and keyword filtering.

 Header/footer and mention stripping options function as expected.

5. Advanced Message Handling, Reply, & Edit Sync
 Reply Preservation:

Telegram replies are mapped to Discord threads/replies and back to Telegram as correct replies.

Discord replies are correctly linked when forwarding back to Telegram destination.

 Message Editing/Deletion Sync:

Edits to a message on Telegram source are synchronized:

Edited on Discord (via webhook/bot edit).

Edited on destination Telegram (using Bot API edit).

Deletions at source are reflected across Discord and destination chat (deleted or marked as removed).

All mappings are maintained with message IDs for robust sync.

 Discord Bot/Webhook Reply & Edit:

Discord messages use bot or webhook for posting, reply threading, and edits.

Creation of webhooks by source/channel is working if required.

Use of bot/webhook is traceable and edit/sync capable for round-trip handling.

 Format Preservation:

Message formatting (Markdown, HTML, code, links, bold, italics, blockquotes) is preserved as much as possible through all stages.

Emoji and premium emoji render as expected (or fallback if not supported).

Webpage previews and formatting are preserved when supported.

 All Message Types Support:

The system forwards (or gracefully degrades) text, images, files, GIFs, stickers, videos, polls, contacts, locations, web links, etc.

If something is unsupported, the admin is notified (not silently dropped).

Fallbacks for format mismatches (Discord ‚Üî Telegram).

6. Filtering & Controls
 Global and per-pair filtering (keywords, images/media) works reliably.

 Filter lists are updatable at runtime via commands.

 Customizable stripping of header/footer/mentions is respected as per config.

7. Worker, Resource, and Health Management
 Sharded worker processes (20‚Äì30 pairs per process) prevent memory leaks and ensure isolation.

 No measurable memory/CPU leaks with ‚â•100 pairs; load remains stable under stress.

 Garbage collection and scheduled health checks can be triggered by admin commands.

 Workers restart on failure/command, with clean resource release.

 System status and per-worker stats available via bot commands.

8. Error Handling, Logging, and Security
 All errors (posting failures, bad tokens, missing permissions, network errors) are logged and cause admin notification.

 Logs exclude tokens or sensitive information.

 Session files, tokens, and secrets are encrypted at rest.

 API rate limits are respected; no abusive/flooding behavior.

9. Documentation & Admin Help
 README covers:

Bot setup and OAuth (where required)

Session login and management

Pair creation and explanation of all parameters, including bot token

All message types and limitations

Admin controls and in-bot /help

Error scenarios and log access

 In-bot /help command summarizes all necessary admin usage.

üìù How To Use
Test each item manually or in automated integration tests.

For failures, record details and iterate fixes until 100% of the list passes.

Only sign-off release when all checklist items are green.
