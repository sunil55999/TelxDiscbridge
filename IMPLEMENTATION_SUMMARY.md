- **Message Flow Analytics**: Processing times, success rates, throughput
- **API Monitoring**: Request tracking, rate limiting, response times
- **Health Endpoints**: Detailed metrics for monitoring dashboards

**Key Metrics**:
- `messages_processed_total` - Total messages processed
- `messages_forwarded_total` - Total messages forwarded
- `api_response_time_seconds` - API response time distribution
- `memory_usage_bytes` - System memory consumption
- `session_health_checks_total` - Session monitoring metrics

### 3. ✅ Advanced Regex-Based Filtering

**New File**: `utils/advanced_filters.py`

- **Flexible Pattern Matching**: Full regex support with priority-based processing
- **Built-in Security Patterns**: Protection against spam, phishing, crypto scams
- **Per-Pair & Global Rules**: Granular filtering control
- **Content Modification**: Replace content, add warnings, or block entirely
- **Filter Analytics**: Usage tracking and effectiveness metrics

**Filter Types**:
- **Content Filtering**: Message text pattern matching
- **Username Filtering**: Sender-based filtering
- **Channel Filtering**: Source channel filtering
- **Media Caption Filtering**: Media description filtering

**Actions Available**:
- `block` - Prevent message forwarding
- `allow` - Explicitly allow messages
- `replace_content` - Modify message content
- `add_warning` - Add warning labels

### 4. ✅ Enhanced Admin Interface

**New File**: `admin_bot/advanced_filter_commands.py`

- **Interactive Filter Management**: Comprehensive admin commands
- **Real-time Testing**: Test filters against sample content
- **Configuration Management**: Import/export filter settings
- **Statistics Dashboard**: Filter effectiveness metrics

**New Admin Commands**:
- `/addfilter <pair_id|global> <name> <pattern> <target> <action>` - Add filter rules
- `/listfilters [pair_id] [page]` - View paginated filter lists
- `/removefilter <rule_id> [pair_id]` - Remove specific filters
- `/testfilter <pair_id|global> <test_text>` - Test filters in real-time
- `/filterstats [pair_id] [days]` - View filter statistics
- `/exportfilters [pair_id]` - Export filter configurations
- `/importfilters [pair_id]` - Import filter configurations
- `/securityfilters` - Manage built-in security filters

### 5. ✅ Enhanced Session Health Monitoring

**Improvements to existing system**:
- **Proactive Monitoring**: Shorter intervals with predictive analysis
- **Instant Failover**: Automatic session switching on detected issues
- **Comprehensive Health Metrics**: Detailed session status tracking
- **Integration with Alerting**: Health issues trigger automatic alerts

### 6. ✅ Production-Ready Integration

**New File**: `core/enhanced_main.py`

- **Complete Integration**: All improvements working together
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing functionality preserved
- **Enhanced Health Monitoring**: 30-second comprehensive health checks
- **Automated Alerting**: Memory, CPU, and performance threshold alerts
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper cleanup and resource management

## 🔧 Built-in Security Patterns

The advanced filter system includes comprehensive security protection:

### Malicious Links
- Detects suspicious URL shorteners (bit.ly, tinyurl, etc.)
- Identifies suspicious domains (.tk, .ml, .ga, .cf)
- Flags money-making schemes and scams

### Spam Content
- Blocks pharmacy and medication spam
- Detects lottery and prize scams
- Identifies urgent/immediate action requests
- Flags clickbait content

### Phishing Protection
- Detects account verification scams
- Identifies payment update requests
- Flags security alert phishing attempts

### Cryptocurrency Scams
- Blocks crypto giveaway scams
- Detects investment fraud attempts
- Identifies trading bot scams

## 📊 Monitoring Capabilities

### Real-time Metrics
- Message processing rates and success rates
- API performance and error rates
- System resource utilization
- Filter effectiveness and usage

### Health Monitoring
- Automatic alerts for high memory usage (>500MB)
- CPU usage monitoring with alerts (>80%)
- Message success rate tracking (<90% triggers alerts)
- Error pattern detection and notification

### Dashboard Ready
- Prometheus-compatible metric export
- JSON health endpoint for external monitoring
- Comprehensive status reporting
- Historical data tracking

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Adding a Custom Filter
```bash
/addfilter global spam_detector '(?i)\b(free.*money|easy.*cash)\b' content block
```

### Testing a Filter
```bash
/testfilter global 'Make easy money from home!'
# Returns: ❌ WOULD BLOCK - Blocked by rule: spam_detector
```

### Viewing Filter Statistics
```bash
/filterstats global 7
# Shows 7-day filter performance metrics
```

### Getting System Health
```bash
# Automated health metrics available via enhanced main application
# Shows memory, CPU, message rates, error rates, filter effectiveness
```

## 🔄 Migration Path
